can you help me with programming an instant ramen timer with react? do not give me too much actual code but please help guide me along with what I should do as a plan, some code is fine. the timer will have a start menu and buttons that are the options that start either a 3 minute, 4 minute, 5 minute or a user inputted time. it rings an alarm after the time is done and gives a button to stop the alarm and go back to the menu
